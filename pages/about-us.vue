          The Climate Action Plan Tracker and Information Network of the United
          Nations referred to as “CAPTAIN UN” is a platform hosted by the United
          Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children’s
          Fund (UNICEF).
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          The CAPTAIN UN platform is the reimagining of bringing people and
          information technology together with a collective goal and objective
          of admonishing for action and accountability from government and major
          corporate entities regarding promises made as a result of the Paris
          Climate Accords of 2015. 192 member states are signatories to the
          climate agreement which came into effect in November 2016.
        </p>
        <p class="my-4">
          The tracking of climate plans by governments and corporations is a
          collective one as the benefits of achieving them will transcend
          generations untold. Therefore, UNDP and UNICEF welcome all of you, our
          Eco Champions, to this information network as we strive to save our
          world together.
